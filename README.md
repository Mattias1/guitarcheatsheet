guitarcheatsheet
================

A cheat sheet for my guitar (ukelele), because I have to learn it in some way.

Installation
------------
To run this you need `python`, `tkinter`, `PIL` and the mattycontrols library.

For windows you can install python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
It should install `tkinter` automatically. To install `PIL`, type `pip install Pillow` in a command prompt.

For ubuntu: `sudo apt install python3 python3-pil.imagetk python3-tk`.

Clone https://github.com/Mattias1/mattycontrols and add the folder its' in to the PYTHONPATH
(for example, add `export PYTHONPATH=~/python` to your bash alias).

Once installed you can run with `python3 run`.
