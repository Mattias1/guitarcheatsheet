guitarcheatsheet
================

A cheat sheet for my guitar (ukelele), because I have to learn it in some way.

Installation
------------
To run this you need `python`, `tkinter` and `PIL`.

For windows you can install python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
It should install `tkinter` automatically. To install `PIL`, type `pip install Pillow` in a command prompt.

For ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pil.imagetk python3-tk`.

Once installed you can run with `python3 run`.
